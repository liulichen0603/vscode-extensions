#
# This file is used to determine which files should be ignored by the "Search Code"
# feature.
#
# Note that the list of files considered is already pre-filtered by the
# contents of "ChromiumExplorer.ignore" file.
#
# Note also that even if a file is not ignored here, it still has to match an inclusion
# rule in "SearchableFiles.include".
#
# ==========================================================================================
# SYNTAX
# ------
# The supported syntax is currently a subset of .gitignore syntax.
#
# * Empty lines (or lines starting with "#") are ignored
# * "/" at end of name to indicate directory name matching only.
# * "/" at the beginning to indicate path relative to "root" ("root" being the 
#   Chromium root enlistment in this case).
# * "*" wildcard to indicate any pattern inside a directory/file name.
# * "/**/" and "**/" wildcards to indicate any set of directory between prefix and suffix.
# * "!" is not supported.
