#
# List of patterns to filter out the files/directories of a Chromium enlistment that do not follow
# the Chromium Coding Style guideline (http://www.chromium.org/developers/coding-style).
#
# ==========================================================================================
# SYNTAX
# ------
# The supported syntax is currently a subset of .gitignore syntax.
#
# * Empty lines (or lines starting with "#") are ignored
# * Support "/" at end of name to indicate directory name matching only.
# * Support "/" at the beginning to indicate path relative to "root" ("root" being the 
#   Chromium root enlistment in this case).
# * Support "*" and "**" wildcards
# * NO support for "!"
